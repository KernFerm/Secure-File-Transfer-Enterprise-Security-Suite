## 🔐 Security Architecture

### Zero-Trust Security Model
- **Default Deny**: All devices are untrusted by default
- **Explicit Trust**: Manual approval required for each device
- **Certificate-Based Authentication**: Unique certificates for trusted devices
- **Regular Re-validation**: Trust relationships expire and require renewal

### Encryption Standards
- **Algorithm**: Fernet (AES 128 in CBC mode with HMAC SHA256)
- **Key Management**: Cryptographically secure random key generation
- **Transport Security**: All file transfers encrypted end-to-end
- **No Plaintext Storage**: Sensitive data never stored in plaintext

### Network Security
- **Local Network Only**: No internet connectivity required or used
- **Port Security**: Configurable port binding (default: 12345)
- **IP Filtering**: Automatic subnet detection and filtering
- **Connection Validation**: Multi-layer authentication for all connections

### Input Validation & Sanitization
- **Path Traversal Protection**: Prevents directory traversal attacks
- **File Size Validation**: Configurable limits prevent DoS attacks
- **Filename Sanitization**: Removes dangerous characters and patterns
- **Network Input Filtering**: Validates all network data before processing
